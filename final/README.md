# Rhys's Final Website: The Pokemon Team Organizer!

Here is the [link](https://csc336-fall2025-cbpt.onrender.com).

**Important note:** Do not refresh while you are on any page other than the Home page! The build will get confused. If it does happen just follow the link again!

# So what does it do?

It allows you to input your Pokemon information into the form page and, if it was formatted correctly, it'll update one of the Slot pages to display your Pokemon's information!

# External Libraries?

To be honest I'm so scattered with this finals week that I didn't have time to select and implement one. I am using an external API though! Specifically PokeAPI, which I have linked riiiight [here!](https://pokeapi.co/). I hope that's alright but if not, feel free to take off points, I'm just happy to have made something cool and semi-practical.

# Extra Info

I am well aware my index.css is very poorly formatted. I'll take the time here to say I know I could have made "body" classes for my text blocks and then just changed the color with an id instead of copy pasting it with new colors every time. At the same time I am so burnt out from finals that I just do not care as long as it works. I did some inline styling because line height was messing up my formatting but otherwise, this is all. Thank you for your patience, sorry that my CSS is a nightmare lol.
