# Rhys's Final Website: The Pokemon Team Organizer!

Here is the [link](https://csc336-fall2025-cbpt.onrender.com).

**Important note:** Do not refresh while you are on any page other than the Home page! The build will get confused. If it does happen just follow the link again!

# So what does it do?

It allows you to input your Pokemon information into the form page and, if it was formatted correctly, it'll update one of the Slot pages to display your Pokemon's information!

# External Libraries?

To be honest I'm so scattered with this finals week that I didn't have time to select and implement one. I am using an external API though! Specifically PokeAPI, which I have linked riiiight [here!](https://pokeapi.co/). I hope that's alright but if not, feel free to take off points, I'm just happy to have made something cool and semi-practical.

# Extra Info

Will update this if I think of anything. Thanks for the amazing semester!!
