    <p1>A Metroidvania is a genre that derives its name from the Metroid and Castlevania game series, and usually includes these elements:</p1>
    <ul>
        <li>Open-ended worlds that emphasize returning to cleared areas with new abilities to unlock more sections</li>
        <li>Progression locked behind certain weapon or movement upgrades</li>
        <li>Collectathon-esque upgrades that enable a multitude of methods of powering up your character</li>
    </ul>
    <p2>
    Hollow Knight is not solely a Metroidvania, as it has elements from other genres, but it is it most significant genre for the purpose of comparison.
