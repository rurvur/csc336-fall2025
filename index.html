    <h3 style="background-color: #fd5e5e;">Announcement</h3>
    <p1>Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced on February 14th, 2019. Since then the game has had 3 trailers:</p1>
    <ul>
        <li>A reveal trailer on 2/14/2019</li>
        <li>A trailer for XBox Game Pass on 6/12/2022</li>
        <li>A Release Trailer on 8/21/2025</li>
    </ul>
    <p2>
    Each trailer had at least a 3 year gap between each other, with little to no other information being released. 
    The result was an extremely anxiety-ridden development cycle where fans of Hollow Knight speculated
     as to whether the game was still in the works
