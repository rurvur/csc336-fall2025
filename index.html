    <p1>Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced on February 14th, 2019. Since then the game has had 3 trailers:</p1>
    <ul>
        <li>A reveal trailer on 2/14/2019</li>
        <li>A trailer for XBox Game Pass on 6/12/2022</li>
        <li>A Release Trailer on 8/21/2025</li>
    </ul>
    <p2>
    Each trailer had at least a 3 year gap between each other, with little to no other information being released. The result was 
    an extremely anxiety-ridden development cycle where fans of Hollow Knight speculated as to whether the game was still in the 
    works. <br>

    <h4 style="background-color: #959cff;">A little information</h4>
    <p3>
    Being a sequel to the 2017 <a href="metroidvania.html">Metroidvania</a> Hollow Knight, Silksong already has en established
    following. While that may seem like a boon for the game, it makes the long development and periods of silence much more
    impactful, as it means there is already a dedicated following who have been waiting since its announcement. There's been
    roughly a 9 year gap between Hollow Knight's final update and Silksong' release, and the announcement of the game was
    nearly 7 years ago. <br> When you consider that this was originally planned as DLC for Hollow Knight, it becomes evident
    why the fanbase has been...antsy, to put it lightly.

    <h5 style="background-color: #95ffa3;">The XBox Trailer</h4>
    <p4>
    Nearly 3 years after reveal, in 2022, a while after COVID-19 put the industry on hold, Silksong got another new trailer announcing 
    its inclusion in XBox GamePass on its release. While it unleashed a surge of interest from fans, in the long run this would
    serve as a benchmark for the next extreme stretch of silence. The first 3 year gap had the excuse of including the time in
    lockdown, this next 3 year gap would not have such an easy excuse.
