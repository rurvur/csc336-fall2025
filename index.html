    <h3 style="background-color: #fd5e5e;">Announcement</h3>
    <p1>Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced on February 14th, 2019. Since then the game has had 3 trailers:</p1>
    <ul>
        <li>A reveal trailer on 2/14/2019</li>
        <li>A trailer for XBox Game Pass on 6/12/2022</li>
        <li>A Release Trailer on 8/21/2025</li>
    </ul>
    <p2>
    Each trailer had at least a 3 year gap between each other, with little to no other information being released. The result was 
    an extremely anxiety-ridden development cycle where fans of Hollow Knight speculated as to whether the game was still in the 
    works. <br>

    <p3>
    Being a sequel to the 2017 <a href="metroidvania.html">Metroidvania</a> Hollow Knight, Silksong already has en established
    following. WHile that may seem like a boon for the game, it makes the long development and periods of silence much more
    impactful, as it means there is already a dedicated following who have been waiting since its announcement.
