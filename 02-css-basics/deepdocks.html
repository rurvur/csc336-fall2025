            Where the metal is tempered, the workers are short-tempered, and the air is scorching!

            Beyond the Marrow lies the Deep Docks, based on top of a vast lake of lava that extends into the Marrow and Far Fields. The Docks have a 
            thriving population of metalworkers. And by thriving, I mean they're really quite hostile, save for two in the basement of the Docks.
            Be cautious, and watch your step!

            If you visit the forge, you may be able to have some tools ordered to help you on your climb! Be wary of the other workers as you make your way there, though!
