        <p>
            Covered in spiny bone-like structures, rumor has it the Marrow is largely comprised of the leftover bones of giant bugs that used to exist.
            Thankfully, you probably won't encounter anything like that. The worst you'll have to deal with is boulders, spikes, lava, and some passive,
            albeit dangerous bugs that have taken the skulls left behind by these old bugs as shells.

            Watch out for the Bell Beast!
        </p>

        <p>
            A dangerous beast encased in thick threads has been spotted in the bell tunnels up north. Thankfully it is completely restrained, but it is
            highly aggressive and should not be approached under any circustances. Be safe, and when in doubt, take the long way out.
