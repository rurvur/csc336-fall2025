            Behold, the Moss Grotto!
        </h1>
        <p id="special">
            A lush land of greenery, grubs, and a gross lack of activity!
        </p>
        <p>
            There's not much to do around here other than admire the many species of moss, though steer clear of your fellow pilgrims, and watch for traps!
            Those who stick around here too long as susceptible to becoming infected by something...<s><a href="cursed.html">strange...</a></s>
        </p>
        <p>
            Though there is one thing...a strange monument erected to honor a species long forgotten. We are unsure of any greater purpose it may serve.
